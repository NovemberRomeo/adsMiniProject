This Algorithms, Data Structures and Software Engineering for Media Technology
 Mini-Project is focused on the maximum subarray problem, wherein I was tasked with finding a contiguous subarray within a given array (for example A[i....j]), and finding the sum of the elements from said array such that a maximum is calculated.

Within the two pieces of code, you can find Divide-and-Conquer as well as Kadane's algorithm  in seperate files with a data.csv containing the array's I used in the algorithms (courtesy of random.org)
